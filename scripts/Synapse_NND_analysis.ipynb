{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"capDbEJ00Yh-"},"source":["**Nearest Neighbour Distance to the closest Synapse analysis**\n","\n","**About this script**\n","> This script takes as an input a compressed zipped file called 'Analysis.zip' containing two directories: Neurites and Synapses. Each directory contains .csv files with different features of neurites or synapses respectively. This script takes the centroids of the synapses and calculates their NND to the closest and to n closest synapses within the associated neurite. It also calculates the mean NNDs and adds them as new columns to the neurite csv information. The output is in a new 'Results' directory and it contains the pooled results per synapses and per neurites in two separate .csv files.\n","\n","> MIT License\n","\n","  Copyright (c) Nicolas Peredo\n","\n","  This script was generated by Nicolas Peredo for Jacqueline Van Vierbergen on the 11/03/2024.\n","\n","> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n"," of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n","  in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n","  to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n","  copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n","  furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n","\n","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n","copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n","\n","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n","IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n","FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
